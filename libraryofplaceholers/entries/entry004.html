What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something. This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship, might suit our needs. That's no moon! It's a space station. It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've letructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort. Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship."
